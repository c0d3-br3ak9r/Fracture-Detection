# Exercise recommendation for bone injury 
Accidents have become very common nowadays as a result there is a rise in bone injuries. People are hesitant to pay visits to physiotherapists. Moreover, physiotherapy is becoming increasingly expensive, and economically backward people are unable to afford it. Additionally, people also suffer from a lack of motivation to continue their exercise. 
So, the idea is to build an application that accepts x-ray images of people with defects in their bones and provides recommendations to improve the health of the ailing body part. The users can also select the type of injury and access exercises accordingly. Exercises of all body parts can be accessed by the user. Since the application is portable, exercises can be performed anywhere. This application is cost-effective, reliable, and efficient. It also involves animation that demonstrates the exercises. It monitors the progress of the user. The points are awarded for the completed exercises to encourage users.
Being physically active can improve mental health, helps to manage weight and strengthen bones and muscles, and improve the ability to do everyday activities. Our application motivates the users with attractive animated exercises thereby aiding recovery.
